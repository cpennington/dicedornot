- Include the next block as part of the dauntless results
- Compute value for player based on TV, rather than on constant value
- Assign values to stat busts/death?
- Multiply value based on distance from ball
  - At the ball: 2x
  - 1 Square away: 1.5
  - 2 squares away: 1.25
- Scale value based on scoring-threat possibility
- Handle kickoff events that remove players
  - Rocks
  - Sweltering Heat
  - Pitch Invasion
- Check if Surf Injuries are handled?
- Combine Armor + Injury rolls with any move that could knock down, so that the potential for injury is included in the 
- Combine rolls + rerolls?
- Non-removal Kickoff result values?
- Include expected value of armor/injury rolls in rolls that could result in KDs?
- Handle Foul Sendoff value
- Label foul, piling on, surfs on Armor/Injury rolls
- Pass failure (and catch failure) should penalize based on losing the ball (modified TV before vs modified TV after?)
- Merge rolls into the Actions they are part of, tagged by what type of action they are.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Rework base values for ball handling and hitting (and make sure they are including probabilities as param), make sure they have common denominator
2. Handle dodge/BT/Sure Hands skills properly
3. MB/CLAW/TACKLE proper handling on hitting
4. Maybe rework pushes value based on skills of player? If he has CLAW/MB/PO/TACKLE - pushes are wasting a lot of TV?
5. Fix a bug where in Vega Editor its fine, and here its half drawn
6. Add koefficient on dodges before hitting a ballcarrier, and hitting a ballcarrier? And dodges before scoring?
7. Kickoff events handling
8. Remove all those simulations for good? They show nothing right now.
9. Make Leap work.
10. Goblins handling - chainsaw, and all need fixing.
