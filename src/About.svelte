  Welcome to Diced or Not, the Blood Bowl 2 replay dice analyzer! If you've just
  had a particularly good or bad game and you want to know if the dice are to
  blame, this is the site for you. To get started, use the button below to
  select the replay you want to load. These are .bbrz files that are usually
  located in My Documents\BloodBowl2\Profiles\(Coach Name or ID)\Replays. Diced
  or Not will analyze the replay and extract all the dice rolls, then show them
  to you along with a bunch of statistics about just how lucky or unlucky you
  were.
